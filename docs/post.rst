Post Syntax
===========

Overview
--------

A post is made up of two parts: header and body.

The header is in `TOML <https://github.com/mojombo/toml>`_ and body is in `Github Flavored Markdown <http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/>`_,
the two parts are separated with a '---' like separator.

A sample post is::

    title = "Hello World"
    datetime = "2013-06-05 19:38"
    tags = ["sample", "some-tag"]

    # Here is markdown content

Post's Filename Extension
-------------------------

Post's filename extension should be ``.md``, for example, ``my-post.md``.

Post's Header
-------------

The post's header is in TOML.

The header part contains post's information: title, tags, created time, etc.

The required items are ``title`` and ``datetime``, others like ``tags``, ``summary``
are optional.

- the ``datetime`` is a ``%Y-%m-%d %H:%M`` formatted string, it's the post's
  created time.

- the ``tags`` is an array of tags.

- the ``summary`` is your post's summary(default: the post's first certain count characters).

Other variables in header can be got in template::

    {{post.myvar}}

Post's Body

The body is in Markdown. I recommend your this link to learn markdown in minutes: `Markdown CheatSheet <https://github.com/site/markdown_cheatsheet>`_.
